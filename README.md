**Explore the power of unsupervised learning with this collection of clustering algorithms.** This repository showcases implementations and applications of various techniques to group data points based on their inherent similarities.

## ‚ú® Explore the Clusters

1.  **Clone:** `git clone https://github.com/Devanshu-Chauhan-955/Clustering.git && cd Clustering`
2.  **Dive In:** Navigate through the notebooks or Python scripts in the repository. Each likely focuses on a specific clustering algorithm or dataset.
3.  **Run & Learn:** Execute the code to see clustering in action, often with visualizations to understand the results.

## üìÇ Project Contents

*   **Notebooks (`*.ipynb`):** Interactive Jupyter notebooks demonstrating different clustering algorithms on various datasets. Expect to find implementations and visualizations for algorithms like:
    *   K-Means Clustering
    *   Hierarchical Clustering
    *   DBSCAN
    *   Potentially others!
*   **Python Scripts (`*.py`):** Standalone Python scripts that might implement specific clustering techniques or workflows.
*   **Data (`data/` or similar):** Datasets used for demonstrating the clustering algorithms.
*   **Visualizations (`images/` or within notebooks):** Visual representations of the clustered data.
*   `README.md`: You're looking at it!
*   `requirements.txt`: (Likely present) Lists the Python libraries needed to run the code (e.g., `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).

## üí° What You'll Discover

*   **Hands-on Implementations:** Practical code examples of popular clustering algorithms.
*   **Visual Insights:** Clear visualizations to understand how different algorithms group data.
*   **Dataset Exploration:** Application of clustering on various datasets to observe their behavior.
*   **Algorithm Comparison:** (Potentially) Insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different clustering methods.

## üöÄ Get Started Locally

1.  **Clone the repo** (see Quick Start above).
2.  **Set up your environment:**
    \begin{verbatim}
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install ipykernel  # If running notebooks
    python -m ipykernel install --user --name=myenv
    \end{verbatim}
3.  **Open and run the notebooks** or execute the Python scripts.

## üî≠ Further Exploration
